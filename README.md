### List
1. `[0.]` Trust
2. I will make mistakes 
   - If you notice something wrong, please file a pull request or email me at [me@ricjanus.com](mailto:me@ricjanus.com). Thanks!
   - I will try to learn from it
3. I will never say or do something to intentionally hurt anyone.
   - It's still possible that I say or do something, but it is never because the intention is to hurt anyone.
   - I can and most probably will think it: take it as me processing for my ideal future
4. 50/50
   - I reserve the right to weigh in 50% of any decision
5. I reserve the right to do something crazy.
6. I reserve the right to keep secrets.
